Feature:
    In order to prove that the Behat Symfony extension is correctly installed
    As a user
    I want to have a demo scenario

    Scenario: It receives a response from Symfony's kernel
        When a demo scenario sends a request to "/"
        Then the response should be received

    /*
     * Initializes context.
     *
     * Every scenario gets its own context instance.
     * You can also pass arbitrary arguments to the
     * context constructor through behat.yml.
     *
     * Sample
     *  @Before/After Suite, Feature, Scenario, Step
     *
     * @When I do something with :stringArgument and with :numberArgument
     * @When there is/are :count monster(s)
     * @When /^there (?:is|are) (\d+) monsters?$/i
     * @When /^I create (\d+) monsters$/i
     * @Given /^(\d+) monster(?:s|) (?:have|has) been created$/i
